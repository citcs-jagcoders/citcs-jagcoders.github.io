## CITCS JAGCoders On-Going Projects

### JAGCoders: Geekdom / City of San Antonio Innovation Group Project

The City of San Antonio needs you help! Right now, Geekdom is teaming up with the City of San Antonio's Innovation Group, and is now calling on TAMUSA CS/CIS students for assistance! This is a great opportunity for students to solve a local problem in the city, and in our case help the San Antonio Library! We are looking to establish a few groups to tackle this project. There will be three meetings in the course of this 16-week project, an initial meeting, a follow-up meeting, and a final meeting with a presentation! This is a great way to make connections with industry professionals and get connected with the City of San Antonio! If you are looking to hone your skills in a real-life problem, and boost your profile, this is it!
