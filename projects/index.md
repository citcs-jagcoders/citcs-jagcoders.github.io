At Texas A&M University-San Antonio, we are the Center for Information Technology and Cyber Security (CITCS)

Our goal is to create a development community of students. This project is called JAGCoders, CITCS's project to increase enrollment in the department of computing and cyber security. 

Our debut of JAGCoders was the Fall of 2018, and we created our first coding challenge drawing in dozens of students. Since that time, we are passionately involved with our students' knowledge in IT and success in academia and the real world industry of Information Technology.
