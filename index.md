# Welcome to Texas A&M University-San Antonio's CITCS JAGCoders GitHub!

Welcome! CITCS is the Center for Information Technology and Cyber Security Department at TAMUSA! This project attempts to build a campus-wide code development community, JAGCoders. The goal of the project is to increase enrollment and retention rate in computing, both Computer Science (CS) and Computer Information Systems (CIS) programs, at Texas A&M University-San Antonio (A&M-SA). It aligns with becoming a national model on how to bring more students to be skilled programmers and not only increase the retention rate for the target programs but also increase enrollment in the programs at TAMU-SA. The goal will be achieved by four major activities:

1. **Programming Teaching Assistants and Tutoring** – provide tutoring services for Fundamental Programming I and II (freshman level) and Programming III (sophomore) courses
2. **Code Savvy** – provide bi-weekly workshops
3. **Code Jam** – prepare and participate in Code Jam programming competitions
4. **Code-Development Community Website** – develop a collaborative code development website

## About JAGCoders

Our debut of JAGCoders was the Fall of 2018, and we created our first coding challenge drawing in dozens of students. Since that time, we are passionately involved with our students' knowledge in IT and success in academia and the real world industry of Information Technology.
